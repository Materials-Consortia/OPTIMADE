Designing new materials suitable for specific applications is a long, complex, and costly process.
Researchers think of new ideas based on intuition and experience.
Their synthesis and evaluation require a tremendous amount of trial and error.

In the last few years, there has been a major game change in materials design.
Thanks to the exponential growth of computer power and the development of
robust first-principles electronic structure codes,
it has become possible to perform large sets of calculations automatically.
This is the burgeoning area of high-throughput ab initio computation.
Such calculations have been used to create large databases containing
the calculated properties of existing and hypothetical materials,
many of which have appeared online:
