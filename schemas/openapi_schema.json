            "description": "A list of symmetry operations given as general position x, y and z coordinates in algebraic form.\n\nEach symmetry operation is described by a string that gives that symmetry operation in Jones' faithful representation (Bradley & Cracknell, 1972: pp. 35-37), adapted for computer string notation.\nThe letters x, y and z that are typesetted with overbars in printed text represent coordinate values multiplied by -1 and are encoded as -x, -y and -z, respectively.\nThe syntax of the strings representing symmetry operations MUST conform to regular expressions given in appendix The Symmetry Operation String Regular Expressions.\nThe interpretation of the strings MUST follow the conventions of the IUCr CIF core dictionary (IUCr, 2023).\nIn particular, this property MUST explicitly provide all symmetry operations needed to generate all the atoms in the unit cell from the atoms in the asymmetric unit, for the setting used.\nThis symmetry operation set MUST always include the `\"x,y,z\"` identity operation.\nThe symmetry operations are to be applied to fractional atom coordinates.\nIn case only Cartesian coordinates are available, these Cartesian coordinates must be converted to fractional coordinates before the application of the provided symmetry operations.\nIf the symmetry operation list is present, it MUST be compatible with other space group specifications (e.g. the ITC space group number, the Hall symbol, the Hermann-Mauguin symbol) if these are present.\n\n- **Type**: list of strings\n\n- **Requirements/Conventions**:\n    - **Support**: OPTIONAL support in implementations, i.e., MAY be `null`.\n\n      - The property is RECOMMENDED if coordinates are returned in a form to which these operations can or must be applied (e.g. fractional atom coordinates of an asymmetric unit).\n      - The property is REQUIRED if symmetry operations are necessary to reconstruct the full model of the material and no other symmetry information (e.g., the Hall symbol) is provided that would allow the user to derive symmetry operations unambiguously.\n    - MUST be null if `nperiodic_dimensions` is equal to 0.\n\n- **Examples**:\n\n  - Space group operations for the space group with ITC number 3 (H-M symbol `P 2`, extended H-M symbol `P 1 2 1`, Hall symbol `P 2y`): `[\"x,y,z\", \"-x,y,-z\"]`\n  - Space group operations for the space group with ITC number 5 (H-M symbol `C 2`, extended H-M symbol `C 1 2 1`, Hall symbol `C 2y`): `[\"x,y,z\", \"-x,y,-z\", \"x+1/2,y+1/2,z\", \"-x+1/2,y+1/2,-z\"]`\n\n- **Notes**:\n  The list of space group symmetry operations applies to the whole periodic array of atoms and together with the lattice translations given in the `lattice_vectors` property provides the necessary information to reconstruct all atom site positions of the periodic material.\n  Thus, the symmetry operations described in this property are only applicable to material models with at least one periodic dimension.\n  This property is not meant to represent arbitrary symmetries of molecules, non-periodic (finite) collections of atoms or non-crystallographic symmetry.\n\n- **Bibliographic References**:\n\n  Bradley, C.

Cases in which the numbers do not sum to one typically fall only in the following two categories:\n\n            - Numerical errors when representing float numbers in fixed precision, e.g. for two chemical symbols with concentrations `1/3` and `2/3`, the concentration might look something like `[0.33333333333, 0.66666666666]`. If the client is aware that the sum is not one because of numerical precision, it can renormalize the values so that the sum is exactly one.\n            - Experimental errors in the data present in the database. In this case, it is the responsibility of the client to decide how to process the data.\n\n            Note that concentrations are uncorrelated between different sites (even of the same species).\n\n        - **attached**: OPTIONAL; if provided MUST be a list of length 1 or more of strings of chemical symbols for the elements attached to this site, or \"X\" for a non-chemical element.\n\n        - **nattached**: OPTIONAL; if provided MUST be a list of length 1 or more of integers indicating the number of attached atoms of the kind specified in the value of the `attached` key.\n\n          The implementation MUST include either both or none of the `attached` and `nattached` keys, and if they are provided, they MUST be of the same length.\n          Furthermore, if they are provided, the `structure_features` property MUST include the string `site_attachments`.\n\n        - **mass**: OPTIONAL.

It MUST have the same length as `sites_in_groups`.\n            It SHOULD sum to one.\n            See below for examples of how to specify the probability of the occurrence of a vacancy.\n            The possible reasons for the values not to sum to one are the same as already specified above for the `concentration` of each `species`.\n\n    - If a site is not present in any group, it means that it is present with 100 % probability (as if no assembly was specified).\n    - A site MUST NOT appear in more than one group.\n\n- **Examples** (for each entry of the assemblies list):\n    - `{\"sites_in_groups\": [[0], [1]], \"group_probabilities: [0.3, 0.7]}`: the first site and the second site never occur at the same time in the unit cell.\n        Statistically, 30 % of the times the first site is present, while 70 % of the times the second site is present.\n    - `{\"sites_in_groups\": [[1,2], [3]], \"group_probabilities: [0.3, 0.7]}`: the second and third site are either present together or not present; they form the first group of atoms for this assembly.\n        The second group is formed by the fourth site.\n        Sites of the first group (the second and the third) are never present at the same time as the fourth site.\n        30 % of times sites 1 and 2 are present (and site 3 is absent); 70 % of times site 3 is present (and sites 1 and 2 are absent).\n\n- **Notes**:\n    - Assemblies are essential to represent, for instance, the situation where an atom can statistically occupy two different positions (sites).\n\n    - By defining groups, it is possible to represent, e.g., the case where a functional molecule (and not just one atom) is either present or absent (or the case where it it is present in two conformations)\n\n    - Considerations on virtual alloys and on vacancies: In the special case of a virtual alloy, these specifications allow two different, equivalent ways of specifying them.\n        For instance, for a site at the origin with 30 % probability of being occupied by Si, 50 % probability of being occupied by Ge, and 20 % of being a vacancy, the following two representations are possible:\n\n        - Using a single species:\n            ```json\n            {\n              \"cartesian_site_positions\": [[0,0,0]],\n              \"species_at_sites\": [\"SiGe-vac\"],\n              \"species\": [\n              {\n                \"name\": \"SiGe-vac\",\n                \"chemical_symbols\": [\"Si\", \"Ge\", \"vacancy\"],\n                \"concentration\": [0.3, 0.5, 0.2]\n              }\n              ]\n              // ...\n            }\n            ```\n\n        - Using multiple species and the assemblies:\n            ```json\n            {\n              \"cartesian_site_positions\": [ [0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0] ],\n              \"species_at_sites\": [\"Si\", \"Ge\", \"vac\"],\n              \"species\": [\n                { \"name\": \"Si\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"Si\"], \"concentration\": [1.0] },\n                { \"name\": \"Ge\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"Ge\"], \"concentration\": [1.0] },\n                { \"name\": \"vac\", \"chemical_symbols\": [\"vacancy\"], \"concentration\": [1.0] }\n              ],\n              \"assemblies\": [\n                {\n              \"sites_in_groups\": [ [0], [1], [2] ],\n              \"group_probabilities\": [0.3, 0.5, 0.2]\n                }\n              ]\n              // ...\n            }\n            ```\n\n    - It is up to the database provider to decide which representation to use, typically depending on the internal format in which the structure is stored.\n        However, given a structure identified by a unique ID, the API implementation MUST always provide the same representation for it.\n\n    - The probabilities of occurrence of different assemblies are uncorrelated.\n        So, for instance in the following case with two assemblies:\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"assemblies\": [\n            {\n              \"sites_in_groups\": [ [0], [1] ],\n              \"group_probabilities\": [0.2, 0.8],\n            },\n            {\n              \"sites_in_groups\": [ [2], [3] ],\n              \"group_probabilities\": [0.3, 0.7]\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n        ```\n\n        Site 0 is present with a probability of 20 % and site 1 with a probability of 80 %. These two sites are correlated (either site 0 or 1 is present). Similarly, site 2 is present with a probability of 30 % and site 3 with a probability of 70 %.\n        These two sites are correlated (either site 2 or 3 is present).\n        However, the presence or absence of sites 0 and 1 is not correlated with the presence or absence of sites 2 and 3 (in the specific example, the pair of sites (0, 2) can occur with 0.2*0.3 = 6 % probability; the pair (0, 3) with 0.2*0.7 = 14 % probability; the pair (1, 2) with 0.8*0.3 = 24 % probability; and the pair (1, 3) with 0.8*0.7 = 56 % probability).",
