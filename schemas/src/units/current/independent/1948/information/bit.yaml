description: |-
  A basic unit of digital information representing a single logical state with one of two possible values, defined by Shannon in 1948.

  "If the base 2 is used the resulting units may be called binary digits, or more briefly bits, a word suggested by J. W. Tukey. A device with two stable positions, such as a relay or a flip-flop circuit, can store one bit of information." ["A Mathematical Theory of Communication", C. E. Shannon, The Bell System Technical Journal 27, 379 (1948)].
