  The litre, or liter is a unit of volume equal to a cubic decimetre (1 dm³) implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the meter at the 17th CGPM Meeting in 1983, resolution 1.

  "The 12th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) [...] declares that the word 'litre' may be employed as a special name for the cubic decimetre" [12th CGPM meeting (1964), resolution 6].

  The litre was defined at the 12th CGPM meeting in 1964, resolution 6, and implicitly redefined with the redefinition of the metre at the 17th CGPM Meeting in 1983, resolution 1.
