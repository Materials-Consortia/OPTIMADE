  The knot appear in the International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) defined as "1 nautical mile per hour = (1852/3600) m/s."

  The International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) categorizes the unit as "Units in use temporarily with the International System."
  The International System of Units (SI), 7th ed. (1998) changes the categorization to "Other non-SI units currently accepted for use with the International System."
  The International System of Units (SI), 8th ed. (2006) changes the categorization to "Other non-SI units."
  The knot is omitted in the International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition (2019).
