  A derived SI unit for absorbed dose of ionizing radiation equal to m²·s⁻² using the 1983 SI units.

  "The 15th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures, [...] adopts the following special name for the SI unit of ionizing radiation: gray, symbol Gy, equal to one joule per kilogram." [15th CGPM Meeting (1975)]

  The gray was defined at the 15th CGPM Meeting in 1975, and implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the meter at the 17th CGPM Meeting in 1983, resolution 1.
