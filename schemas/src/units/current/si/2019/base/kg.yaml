  The kilogram is the SI base unit of mass defined according to the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units.
  It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant $h$ to be 6.62607015×10⁻³⁴ when expressed in the unit J⋅s, which is equal to kg⋅m²⋅s⁻¹, where the metre and the second are defined in terms of $c$ and $\Delta \nu_\textrm{Cs}$ [The International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition].
