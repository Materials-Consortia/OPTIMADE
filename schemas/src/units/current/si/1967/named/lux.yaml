  A derived SI unit for illuminance equal to cd⋅sr⋅m⁻² in 1967 SI units.

  "The lux is the illuminance of a surface that receives a uniformly distributed luminous flux of one lumen per square meter." [9th CGPM meeting in 1946]

  The lux was defined at the 9th CGPM Meeting in 1946, included in SI at the 11th CGPM meeting in 1960, resolution 12 and implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the second at the 13th CGPM Meeting in 1967, resolution 1.
