description: |-
  List of three integers describing the periodicity of the boundaries of the unit cell. For each direction indicated by the three lattice_vectors, this list indicates if the direction is periodic (value 1) or non-periodic (value 0). Note: the elements in this list each refer to the direction of the corresponding entry in lattice_vectors and not the Cartesian x, y, z directions.

  **Requirements/Conventions**:

  - MUST be a list of length 3.
  - Each integer element MUST assume only the value 0 or 1.

  **Explained examples**:

  - A nonperiodic structure, for example, for a single molecule : `[0, 0, 0]`
  - A unit cell that is periodic in the direction of the third lattice vector, for example for a carbon nanotube: `[0, 0, 1]`
  - For a 2D surface/slab, with a unit cell that is periodic in the direction of the first and third lattice vectors: `[1, 0, 1]`
  - For a bulk 3D system with a unit cell that is periodic in all directions: `[1, 1, 1]`
examples:
  - [0, 0, 0]
  - [0, 0, 1]
  - [1, 0, 1]
