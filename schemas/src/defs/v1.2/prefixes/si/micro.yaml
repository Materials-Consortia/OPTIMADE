description: |-
  The micro SI prefix defined as a dimensionless multiple of 10⁻⁶, adopted into SI at its creation at the 11th CGPM Meeting in 1960, resolution 12.

  The micro SI prefix is the only one using a non Latin symbol.
  Based on the recommendation of the ISMP List of Error-Prone Abbreviations, Symbols, and Dose Designations to use mcg in place of μg, mc is used for a symbol for micro using the Latin alphabet.
