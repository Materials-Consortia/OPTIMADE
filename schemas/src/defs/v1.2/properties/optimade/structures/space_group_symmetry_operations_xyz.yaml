description: |-
  A list of symmetry operations given as general position x, y and z coordinates in algebraic form.

  **Requirements/Conventions**:

  - Each symmetry operation is described by a string that gives that symmetry operation in Jones' faithful representation (Bradley & Cracknell, 1972: pp. 35-37), adapted for computer string notation.
  - The letters `x`, `y` and `z` that are typesetted with overbars in printed text represent coordinate values multiplied by -1 and are encoded as `-x`, `-y` and `-z`, respectively.
  - The syntax of the strings representing symmetry operations MUST conform to regular expressions given in appendix `The Symmetry Operation String Regular Expressions`_.
  - The interpretation of the strings MUST follow the conventions of the IUCr CIF core dictionary (IUCr, 2023).
  - In particular, this property MUST explicitly provide all symmetry operations needed to generate all the atoms in the unit cell from the atoms in the asymmetric unit, for the setting used.
  - This symmetry operation set MUST always include the `x,y,z` identity operation.
  - The symmetry operations are to be applied to fractional atom coordinates.
  - In case only Cartesian coordinates are available, these Cartesian coordinates must be converted to fractional coordinates before the application of the provided symmetry operations.
  - If the symmetry operation list is present, it MUST be compatible with other space group specifications (e.g. the ITC space group number, the Hall symbol, the Hermann-Mauguin symbol) if these are present.

  **Notes**:

  - The list of space group symmetry operations applies to the whole periodic array of atoms and together with the lattice translations given in the :property:`lattice\_vectors` property provides the necessary information to reconstruct all atom site positions of the periodic material.
  - Thus, the symmetry operations described in this property are only applicable to material models with at least one periodic dimension.
  - This property is not meant to represent arbitrary symmetries of molecules, non-periodic (finite) collections of atoms or non-crystallographic symmetry.
