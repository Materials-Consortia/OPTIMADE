  - MUST be equal to the lengths of the list properties elements and elements_ratios, if they are provided.

  **Querying**:

  - Queries on this property can equivalently be formulated using `elements LENGTH`.
  - A filter that matches structures that have exactly 4 elements: `nelements=4`.
  - A filter that matches structures that have between 2 and 7 elements: `nelements>=2 AND nelements<=7`.
