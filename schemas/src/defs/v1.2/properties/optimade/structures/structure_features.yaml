  A list of strings that flag which special features are used by the structure.

  **Requirements/Conventions:**

  - MUST be an empty list if no special features are used.
  - MUST be sorted alphabetically.
  - If a special feature listed below is used, the list MUST contain the corresponding string.
  - If a special feature listed below is not used, the list MUST NOT contain the corresponding string.
  - **List of strings used to indicate special structure features:**
    - `disorder`: this flag MUST be present if any one entry in the species list has a `chemical_symbols` list that is longer than 1 element.
    - `implicit_atoms`: this flag MUST be present if the structure contains atoms that are not assigned to sites via the property `species_at_sites` (e.g., because their positions are unknown). When this flag is present, the properties related to the chemical formula will likely not match the type and count of atoms represented by the `species_at_sites`, `species`, and `assemblies` properties.
    - `site_attachments`: this flag MUST be present if any one entry in the species list includes `attached` and `nattached`.
    - `assemblies`: this flag MUST be present if the property assemblies is present.

    **Explained examples**:
    - A structure having implicit atoms and using assemblies: `["assemblies", "implicit_atoms"]`

examples:
  - ["assemblies", "implicit_atoms"]
