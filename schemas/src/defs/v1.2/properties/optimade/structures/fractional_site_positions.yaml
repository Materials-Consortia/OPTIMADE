description: |-
  Fractional coordinates (positions) of each site in the structure.

  A site is usually used to describe positions of atoms; what atoms can be encountered at a given site is conveyed by the `species_at_sites` property, and the species themselves are described in the `species` property.
  Site coordinates MAY be given as `cartesian_site_positions`, `fractional_site_positions`, or both.
  When symmetry operations given in `space_group_symmetry_operations_xyz` are applied, they MUST be applied to coordinates given in the `fractional_site_positions` array.

  **Requirements/Conventions**:

  - It MUST be a list of length equal to the number of sites in the structure, where every element is a list of the three fractional coordinates of a site expressed as float values in the fractions of the unit cell vectors given by the `lattice_vectors` property.
  - An entry MAY have multiple sites at the same site position (for a relevant use of this, see e.g., the property `assemblies`).
  - Since both `cartesian_site_positions` and the `fractional_site_positions` always describe the same sites, they MUST always have the same number of elements, equal to the number of elements in the `species_at_sites` array.

  **Explained examples**:

  - `[[0,0,0],[0,0,0.2]]` indicates a structure with two sites, one sitting at the origin and one along the third unit cell axis (*c*-axis), 1/5-th (0.2) of the vector *c* in the direction of the vector *c* from the origin.
examples:
  - [[0,0,0],[0,0,0.2]]
