description: |-
  The chemical symbols of the different elements present in the structure.

  **Requirements/Conventions**:

  - The strings are the chemical symbols, i.e., either a single uppercase letter or an uppercase letter followed by a number of lowercase letters.
  - The order MUST be alphabetical.
  - MUST refer to the same elements in the same order, and therefore be of the same length, as `elements_ratios`, if the latter is provided.
  - Note: This property SHOULD NOT contain the string "X" to indicate non-chemical elements or "vacancy" to indicate vacancies (in contrast to the field `chemical_symbols` for the species property).

  **Query examples**:

  - A filter that matches all records of structures that contain Si, Al **and** O, and possibly other elements: `elements HAS ALL "Si", "Al", "O"`.
  - To match structures with exactly these three elements, use `elements HAS ALL "Si", "Al", "O" AND elements LENGTH 3`.
  - Note: length queries on this property can be equivalently formulated by filtering on the `nelements` property directly.
examples:
  - ['Al', 'Si', 'O']
  - ['He']
