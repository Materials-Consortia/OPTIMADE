description: |-
  Electronic band gap - energy difference between valence and conduction bands determining electrical properties. Metals have zero gap, semiconductors 0-4 eV, insulators >4 eV. Can be direct (same k-point) or indirect (different k-points), affecting optical properties.

  **Query examples**:

  - Filter for semiconductors: `band_gap>0 AND band_gap<4`.
  - Filter for insulators: `band_gap>4`.
  - Filter for metals: `band_gap=0`.
