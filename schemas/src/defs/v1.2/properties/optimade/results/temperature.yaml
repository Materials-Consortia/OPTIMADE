description: |-
  Temperature at which the result was obtained. For computational results, represents simulation temperature; for experimental results, represents measurement conditions. Critical for thermodynamic properties and phase behavior.

  **Requirements/Conventions**:

  - The temperature SHOULD be provided in K (kelvin).
  - For computational results, this represents the simulation temperature.
  - For experimental results, this represents the measurement temperature.
  - Standard room temperature is approximately 298.15 K.

  **Query examples**:

  - Filter for room temperature results: `temperature>=295 AND temperature<=305`.
  - Filter for high temperature results: `temperature>1000`.
examples:
  - 298.15
  - 77.0
  - 1273.0
