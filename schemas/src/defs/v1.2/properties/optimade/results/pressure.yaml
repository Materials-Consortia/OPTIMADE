description: |-
  Pressure at which the result was obtained. For computational results, represents simulation pressure; for experimental results, represents measurement conditions. Essential for equation of state studies and high-pressure phase transitions.

  **Requirements/Conventions**:

  - The pressure SHOULD be provided in Pa (pascals).
  - For computational results, this represents the simulation pressure.
  - For experimental results, this represents the measurement pressure.
  - Standard atmospheric pressure is approximately 101325 Pa.

  **Query examples**:

  - Filter for atmospheric pressure results: `pressure>=100000 AND pressure<=105000`.
  - Filter for high pressure results: `pressure>1e9`.
examples:
  - 101325.0
  - 1e9
  - 5e10
