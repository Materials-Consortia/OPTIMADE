description: |-
  Optical band gap - the minimum photon energy needed for direct optical transitions between bands. Often larger than electronic band gap due to excitonic effects and selection rules. Measured via UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy or calculated from optical properties.

  **Query examples**:

  - Filter for visible light absorbers: `optical_band_gap>=1.5 AND optical_band_gap<=3.1`.
  - Filter for transparent materials: `optical_band_gap>3.5`.
examples:
  - 1.1
  - 3.4
  - 5.6
