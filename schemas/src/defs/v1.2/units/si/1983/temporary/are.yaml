  A unit of area equal to 100 square meters (10² m²), with meter defined according to the 1983 SI units.

  The are appear in the International System of Units (SI), 1st ed. (1970) defined as "1 a = 1 dam² = 10² m²" with the footnote "This unit and its symbol were adopted by the International Committee in 1879 (Proces-Verbaux C.I.P.M., 1879, p. 41).

  - The International System of Units (SI), 1st ed. (1970) categorizes the unit as "units in use temporarily".
  - The International System of Units (SI), 5th ed. (1985) adds the clarification that the unit is "used to express agricultural areas."
  - The International System of Units (SI), 8th ed. (2006) completely removes the unit (but still defines the hectare).
  - The International System of Units (SI), 7th ed. (1998) reintroduces the unit in the category "Other non-SI units currently accepted for use with the International System."

  The are was implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the metre at the 17th CGPM meeting (1983), resolution 1.
