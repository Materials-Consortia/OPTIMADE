  The candela is the SI base unit of luminous intensity in a given direction defined from the luminous intensity of monocromatic radiation at a specific frequency and radiant intensity at the 16th CGPM Meeting in 1979; implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the metre at the 17th CGPM Meeting in 1983.

  "The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540×10¹² hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian." [16th CGPM Meeting (1979), resolution 3].

  Following the redefinition of the metre at the 17th CGPM Meeting in 1983, resolution 1, the implicitly redefined candela references:

  - the SI 1967 derived hertz unit (https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2/si/1967/named/hertz).
  - the SI 1983 derived watt unit (https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2/si/1983/named/watt).
  - the SI 1960 supplementary unit steradian (https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2/si/1960/supplementary/steradian).
