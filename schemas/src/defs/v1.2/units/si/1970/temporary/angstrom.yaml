description: |-
  A length equal to 10⁻¹⁰ meter, with meter defined according to the 1960 SI base units.

  The ångström appear in the International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) defined as "1 Å = 0.1 nm = 10⁻¹⁰ m".

  - The International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) categorizes the unit as "temporarily admitted" for use with the SI units.
  - The International System of Units (SI), 7th ed. (1998) changes the categorisation to "Other non-SI units currently accepted for use with the International System."
  - The International System of Units (SI), 8th ed. (2006) changes the categorization to "Other non-SI units" and adds as a clarifying footnote "The ångström is widely used by x-ray crystallographers and structural chemists because all chemical bonds lie in the range 1 to 3 ångströms. However it has no official sanction from the CIPM or the CGPM."
  - The ångström is omitted in the International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition (2019).
