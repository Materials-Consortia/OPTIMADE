description: |-
  A unit of area used in nuclear physics to express cross sections equal to 100 fm², with meter defined according to the 1960 SI units.

  The International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) states: "1 b = 100 fm² = 10⁻²⁸ m" with a footnote "The barn is a special unit used in nuclear physics to express cross sections."

  - The International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) categorizes the unit as "Units in use temporarily with the International System."
  - The International System of Units (SI), 8th ed. (2006) categorizes the unit as "Other non-SI units currently accepted for use with the International System."
