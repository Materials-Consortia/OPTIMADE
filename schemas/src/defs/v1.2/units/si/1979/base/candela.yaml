description: |-
  The SI base unit of luminous intensity in a given direction defined from the luminous intensity of monocromatic radiation at a specific frequency and radiant intensity at the 16th CGPM Meeting in 1979.

  "The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540×10¹² hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian." [16th CGPM Meeting (1979), resolution 3].

  The hertz, watt, and steradian units referenced in this definition are:

  - the SI 1967 derived hertz unit (https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2/si/1967/named/hertz) equal to second⁻¹, referencing the SI 1967 base unit second (https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2/si/1967/base/second).
  - the SI 1967 derived watt unit (https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2/si/1967/named/watt) equal to kilogram·meter²·second⁻³, referencing the SI 1960 base unit kilogram (https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2/si/1960/base/kilogram) and metre (https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2/si/1960/base/metre); and the 1967 base unit second (https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2/si/1967/base/second).
  - the SI 1960 supplementary unit steradian (https://schemas.optimade.org/units/v1.2/si/1960/supplementary/steradian).
