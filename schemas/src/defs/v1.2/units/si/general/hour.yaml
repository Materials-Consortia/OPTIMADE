description: |-
  A unit of time equal to 60 minutes, or 3600 seconds, using the current, or one of the historical, definitions of the SI units.

  The hour appear in the International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) defined as "1 h = 60 min = 3600 s".

  - The International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) categorizes the unit as "Units in use with the International System."
  - The International System of Units (SI), 7th ed. (1998) changes the categorization to "Non-SI units accepted for use with the International System."

  This is a generalized definition taken to reference the current, or one of the historical, SI unit definitions.
  This definition is intended for situations when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., in contexts where data have been collected that uses different historical SI definitions.
