description: |-
  The "roentgen equivalent man" (rem) is a unit used in radioprotection meant to represent a dose of any ionizing radiation comparable in effect to one roentgen of high-voltage x-radiation, taken to be equal to 10⁻² Sv using the current, or one of the historical, definitions of the SI units.

  The rem appear in the International System of Units (SI), 4th ed. (1981) defined as "1 rem = 1 cSv = 10⁻² Sv" with the footnote: "The rem is a special unit used in radioprotection to express the equivalent dose."

  This is a generalized definition taken to reference the current, or one of the historical, SI unit definitions.
  This definition is intended for situations when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., in contexts where data have been collected that uses different historical SI definitions.
