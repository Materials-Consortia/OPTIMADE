description: |-
  The "roentgen equivalent man" (rem) is a unit used in radioprotection meant to represent a dose of any ionizing radiation comparable in effect to one roentgen of high-voltage x-radiation, taken to be equal to 10⁻² Sv using the 1967 SI units.

  The rem appear in the International System of Units (SI), 4th ed. (1981) defined as "1 rem = 1 cSv = 10⁻² Sv" with the footnote: "The rem is a special unit used in radioprotection to express the equivalent dose."
