description: |-
  Indicates the extent of the material (crystal) described in the response.
  In particular, properties `cartesian_site_positions` and `fractional_site_positions` MUST contain all sites *belonging* to the described extent.

  The value of this property MUST be one of the following:

    * `fundamental_domain`: means that sites described in the response span a fundamental domain (Vinberg, 1994; European Mathematical Society, 2020) of a periodic system.
      When a server indicates this span in the response, it MUST provide those sites that enable reconstruction of the whole periodic system by applying symmetry operations from `space_group_symmetry_operations_xyz` property and then applying translations given by `lattice_vectors`.
      The fundamental domain does not need to be a connected space region.

    * `asymmetric_unit`: all sites are in a simply connected space region that is a fundamental domain, as per IUCr Online Dictionary of Crystallography definition (IUCr, 2017).

    * `molecular_fundamental_domain`: a fundamental domain where all atoms connected by covalent or donor-acceptor coordination bonds are adjacent to each other, placed at a bond distance.

    * `molecular_asymmetric_unit`: an asymmetric unit (a simply connected fundamental domain) where all atoms bound by covalent or donor-acceptor coordination bonds are adjacent to each other, placed at a bond distance.

    * `unit_cell`: a full unit cell of a periodic system (crystal), i.e., any repeating unit chosen by the server defined by the property `lattice_vectors`.
      For this span, the server MUST provide a set of sites in the response that can be used to reconstruct the whole periodic system (crystal) by simply applying translations from the `lattice_vectors` property to those sites.

    * `molecular_unit_cell`: same as `unit_cell`, but in addition places atoms that are bound by covalent or coordination bonds at a bond distance from each other.

    * `molecular_entities`: sets of atoms that are bound by covalent or coordination bonds, as per IUPAC definition of a 'molecular entity'.
      This set of sites MAY be larger than a fundamental domain.

    * `other`: any other collection of sites that does not fit the enumerated values above.

    * `null`: if omitted or `null`, the default value of `site_coordinate_span` is `unit_cell`.
      This is the assumed behavior of all main implementations before the `site_coordinate_span` definition was introduced.

  **Note**: In all cases it is RECOMMENDED that only the minimal set of the sites that is needed to reconstruct the whole material is provided.
  For example, for the 'unit_cell' span the server SHOULD NOT return sites that can be obtained from other returned sites through the translations given in `lattice_vectors`; only a non-redundant set of sites SHOULD be provided.
