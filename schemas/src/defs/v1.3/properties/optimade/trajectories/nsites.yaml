  A list of nsites items.
  An nsites item is an integer specifying the length of a corresponding `cartesian_site_positions` property (usually in reference to a parallel list of other structure properties).

  For each nsites item the following applies:

  **Requirements/Conventions**:

  - MUST be equal to the lengths of the list properties elements and elements_ratios, if they are provided.

  **Query examples**:

  - Match only structures with exactly 4 sites: `nsites=4`
  - Match structures that have between 2 and 7 sites: `nsites>=2 AND nsites<=7`
examples:
  - [42]
  - [42, 4711]
