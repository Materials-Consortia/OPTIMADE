description: |-
  A list of elements items, where an elements item is a list of the chemical symbols of the different elements present in a structure.

  For each elements item the following applies:

  **Requirements/Conventions**:

  - The strings are the chemical symbols, i.e., either a single uppercase letter or an uppercase letter followed by a number of lowercase letters.
  - The order MUST be alphabetical.
  - MUST refer to the same elements in the same order, and therefore be of the same length, as `elements_ratios`, if the latter is provided.
  - Note: This property SHOULD NOT contain the string "X" to indicate non-chemical elements or "vacancy" to indicate vacancies (in contrast to the field `chemical_symbols` for the species property).
examples:
  - [['Al', 'Si', 'O'], ['Al', 'Si', 'O'], ['Al', 'F'], ['Al', 'Si', 'O', 'He']]
  - [['He']]
