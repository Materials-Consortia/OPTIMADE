description: |-
  An integer specifying the number of periodic dimensions in the structure, equivalent to the number of non-zero entries in `dimension_types`.

  **Requirements/Conventions**:

  - The integer value MUST be between 0 and 3 inclusive and MUST be equal to the sum of the items in the dimension_types property.

  - This property only reflects the treatment of the lattice vectors provided for the structure, and not any physical interpretation of the dimensionality of its contents.

  **Explained examples**

  - `2` should be indicated in cases where dimension_types is any of `[1, 1, 0]`, `[1, 0, 1]`, `[0, 1, 1]`.

  **Query examples**:

  - Match only structures with exactly 3 periodic dimensions: `nperiodic_dimensions=3`
  - Match all structures with 2 or fewer periodic dimensions: `nperiodic_dimensions<=2`
examples:
  - 2
