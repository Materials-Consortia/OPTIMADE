# <a name="h.1">1. Introduction</a>

As researchers create independent materials databases, much can be
gained from retrieving data from multiple databases. However, the
retrieval process is difficult if each database has a different
API. This document defines a standard API for retrieving data from
materials databases. This API was developed by the participants of the
workshop "Open Databases Integration for Materials Design", held at
the Lorentz Center in Leiden, Netherlands from 2016-10-24 to
2016-10-28.

It is the intent that the API in the present document adheres to the
[JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) v1.0 specification (with the exception that
non-conformant responses can be generated if an API user specifically
requests a non-standard response format). In cases where specific
restrictions are given in the JSON API specification that are stricter than what is
formulated in this document, they are expected to be upheld by API
implementations unless otherwise noted in this document.
(This may apply to, e.g., the format of Member Names and/or return codes.)

The full present version number of the specification is shown as part of the
top headline of this document.

# <a name="h.2">2. Term Definition</a>

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

* **Database provider**: A service that provides one or more databases of materials information.
* **Database-provider-specific prefix**: This specification defines a set of
  database-provider-specific prefixes in [Appendix 1](#h.app1).
* **Implementation**: An instance serving the OPTiMaDe API.
* **Database**: An implementation that serves materials information.
* **Entry**: A type of resource, over which a query can be formulated using the API
  (e.g., structure or calculation).
* **Property**: Anything that can be in the filtering of results.
* **Field**: A property that can be requested as partial output from the API.
* **Resource object**: Represent resources. MUST contain at least the following top-level fields:
  `id`, `type`.
* **ID**: A unique identifier that specifies a specific resource in a database,
  which does not need to be immutable. It MUST NOT be a reserved
  word.
* **Immutable ID**: A unique identifier that specifies a specific resource in a
  database that MUST be immutable.
* **Reserved words**: The list of reserved words in this standard is:
  `info`.
* **Property Types**:
  * **string**, **integer**, **float**, **boolean**, **null value**: Base data
    types as defined in more detail in section [5.1. Lexical Tokens](#h.5.1).
  * **list**, **dictionary**: Collection of base types with the meaning they have in the JSON
    data-interchange format, i.e., an ordered list of elements
    (where each element can have a different type) or a hash table
    (with the limitation that the hash key MUST be a string), respectively.

# <a name="h.3">3. General API Requirements and Conventions</a>

## <a name="h.3.1">3.1. Base URL</a>

Each database provider will publish a base URL that serves the API. An
example could be: <http://example.com/optimade/>. Every URL component
that follows the base URL MUST behave as standardized in this API
specification.

The client MAY include a version number in the base URL, prefixed with
the letter "v", where the version number indicates the version of the
API standard that the client requests. The format is either
vMAJOR or vMAJOR.MINOR where MAJOR is the major version number, and
MINOR is the minor version number of the standard being referenced. If
the major version is 0, the minor version MUST also be included. The
database provider MAY support further levels of versioning separated
from the major and minor version by a decimal point, e.g., patch
version on the format vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. However, the client MUST NOT
assume levels beyond the minor version are supported.

If the client does not include a version number in the base URL, the
request is for the latest version of this standard that the database
provider implements. A query that includes a major and/or minor
version is for the latest subversion of that major and/or minor
version that the database provider implements.

A database provider MAY choose to only support a subset of possible
versions. The client can find out which versions are supported using
the `available_api_versions` field of the `attributes` field from a
query to the base URL `info` endpoint (see section
[4.4.1. Base URL Info Endpoint](#h.4.4.1)). The database
provider SHOULD strive to implement the latest subversion of any major
and minor version supported. Specifically, the latest version of this
standard SHOULD be supported.

Examples of valid base URLs:

* <http://example.com/optimade/>
* <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/>
* <http://example.com/>
* <http://example.com/some/path/>

Examples of invalid base URLs:

* <http://example.com/optimade/v0/>
* <http://example.com/optimade/0.9/>

## <a name="h.3.2">3.2. URL Encoding</a>

Clients SHOULD encode URLs according to [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).
API implementations MUST decode URLs according to [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

## <a name="h.3.3">3.3. Responses</a>

### <a name="h.3.3.1">3.3.1. Response Format</a>

API responses MUST be returned in the format specified in the
request. If no specific response format is specified in the request by
use of the `response_format` URL query parameter (see below), the default
response format is [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) specification.
All endpoints MUST support at least the JSON API format.
Each endpoint MAY OPTIONALLY support multiple formats,
and declare these formats in their `info` endpoints
(see section [4.4.2. Entry Listing Info Endpoints](#h.4.4.2)).

An API implementation MAY return other formats than specified here.
These can be implemented and documented according to the database provider.
However, they MUST be prefixed by a database-provider-specific prefix as defined in
[Appendix 1](#h.app1).

Specifying a `response_format` URL query parameter different from JSON API,
allows the implementation to break conformance with the JSON API specification.
Not only in response format, but also in, e.g., how content negotiation is implemented.

### <a name="h.3.3.2">3.3.2. JSON API Response Schema: Common Fields</a>

Every response MUST contain the following fields:

* **meta**: a [JSON API meta member](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-meta)
  that contains JSON API meta objects of non-standard meta-information.  
  It MUST be a dictionary with these fields:

  * **query**: information on the query that was requested.  
    It MUST be a dictionary with these fields:
    * **representation**: a string with the part of the URL following the base URL.

  * **api\_version**: a string containing the version of the API implementation.
  * **time\_stamp**: a string containing the date and time at which the query
    was executed, in [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/standard/40874.html)
    format.  Times MUST be timezone-aware (i.e., MUST NOT be local times),
    in one of the formats allowed by [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/standard/40874.html)
    (i.e., either be in UTC, and then end with a Z, or indicate explicitly
    the offset).
  * **data\_returned**: an integer containing the number of data objects returned for the query.
  * **more\_data\_available**: `false` if all data for this query has been
    returned, and `true` if not.
  * **provider**: information on the database provider of the implementation.  
  It MUST be a dictionary with these fields:
    * **name**: a short name for the database provider.
    * **description**: a longer description of the database provider.
    * **prefix**: database-provider-specific prefix as found in [Appendix 1](#h.app1).

    `provider` MAY OPTIONALLY include these fields:

    * **homepage**: a [JSON API links object](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-links),
    pointing to the homepage of the database provider, either directly as a string,
    or as a link object which can contain the following fields:
      * **href**: a string containing the homepage URL.
      * **meta**: a meta object containing non-standard meta-information about the
      database provider's homepage.
    * **index\_base\_url**: a [JSON API links object](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-links)
    pointing to the base URL for the `index` meta-database of the provider as specified in
    [Appendix 1](#h.app1), either directly as a string, or as a link object
    which can contain the following fields:
      * **href**: a string containing the base URL for the database provider's
      `index` meta-database.
      * **meta**: a meta object containing non-standard meta-information about this link.

      If the `index` meta-database (see section [3.4. Index Meta-Database](#h.3.4)) is implemented by the provider,
      the `index_base_url` field MUST be included.

  `meta` MAY OPTIONALLY also include these fields:

  * **data\_available**: an integer containing the total number of data objects
    available in the database.
  * **last\_id**: a string containing the last ID returned.
  * **response\_message**: response string from the server.
  * Other OPTIONAL additional information _global to the query_ that is not specified
  in this document, MUST start with a database-provider-specific prefix as defined in
  [Appendix 1](#h.app1).

  * Example:  
    For a request made to <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/structures/?filter=a=1> AND b=2

    ```json
    {
      "meta": {
        "query": {
          "representation": "/structures/?filter=a=1 AND b=2",
        },
        "api_version": "v0.9",
        "time_stamp": "2007-04-05T14:30Z",
        "data_returned": 10,
        "data_available": 10,
        "more_data_available": false,
        "provider": {
          "name": "Example provider",
          "description": "Provider used for examples, not to be assigned to a real database",
          "prefix": "exmpl",
          "homepage": "http://example.com"
        }
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```

* **data**: The schema of this value varies by endpoint, it can be either a _single_
[JSON API resource object](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-objects)
or a _list_ of JSON API resource objects. Every resource object needs the `type` and `id` fields,
and its attributes (described in section [4. API Endpoints](#h.4))
need to be in a dictionary corresponding to the `attributes` field.

The response MAY OPTIONALLY also return resources related to the primary data in the field:

* **links**: a [JSON API links member](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-links)
  containing the JSON API links objects:
  * **next**: is an URI that represents a suggested way to fetch the
    next set of results if not all were returned, either directly as a string,
    or as a link object. The field MUST be null or omitted if there is no additional
    data, or if there is no way to fetch additional data. The link object can contain
    the following members:
    * **href**: a string containing the link’s URL.
    * **meta**: a meta object containing non-standard meta-information about the link.

  * **base\_url**: a links object representing the base URL of the implementation. Example:

    ```json
    {
      "links": {
        "base_url": {
          "href": "http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/",
          "meta": {
            "_exmpl_db_version": "3.2.1"
          }
        }
        // ...
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```

* **included**: a list of
[JSON API resource objects](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-objects)
related to the primary data contained in `data`.  
A response with related resources under `included` are in the JSON API known as
[compound documents](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-compound-documents).

If there were errors in producing the response all other fields MAY be skipped, and the following field MUST be present

* **errors**: a list of [JSON API error objects](http://jsonapi.org/format/#error-objects).

An example of a full response:

```json
{
  "links": {
    "next": null,
    "base_url": {
      "href": "http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/",
      "meta": {
         "_exmpl_db_version": "3.2.1"
      }
    }
  },
  "meta": {

      "representation": "/structures?filter=a=1 AND b=2"
    },
    "api_version": "v0.9",

    "data_returned": 10,
    "data_available": 10,
    "last_id": "xy10",
    "more_data_available": false,
    "provider": {
      "name": "Example provider",
      "description": "Provider used for examples, not to be assigned to a real database",
      "prefix": "exmpl",
      "homepage": {
        "href": "http://example.com",
        "meta": {
          "_exmpl_title": "This is an example site"
        }
      },
      "index_base_url": "http://example.com/optimade/index/"
    },
    "response_message": "OK"
    // <OPTIONAL implementation- or database-provider-specific metadata, global to the query>
  },
  "data": [

  "included": [
    // ...
  ],
}
```

### 3.3.4. HTTP Response Status Codes

**Notes**:
If a client receives an unexpected 404 error when making a query to a base URL,
and is aware of the index meta-database that belongs to the database provider
(as described in [3.4. Index Meta-Database](#h.3.4)),
the next course of action SHOULD be to fetch the resource objects under the
`links` endpoint of the index meta-database and redirect the original query
to the corresponding database ID that was originally queried, using the object's
`base_url` value.

## <a name="h.3.4">3.4. Index Meta-Database</a>

The main purpose of this "index" is to allow for automatic discoverability
of all databases of a given provider.
Thus, it acts as a meta-database for the database provider's implementation(s).

The index meta-database MUST only provide the `info` and `links` endpoints,
see sections [4.4. Info Endpoints](#h.4.4) and [4.5. Links Endpoint](#h.4.5).
It MUST not expose any entry listing endpoints (e.g., `structures`).

These endpoints do not need to be queryable, i.e., they MAY be provided as static JSON files.
However, they MUST return the correct and updated information on all currently provided implementations.

The `index_base_url` field MUST be included in every response in the `provider` field under the
top-level `meta` field (see section [3.3.2. JSON API Response Schema: Common Fields](#h.3.3.2)).

The `is_index` field under `attributes`, as well as the `relationships` field, MUST be included in the
`info` endpoint for the index meta-database (see section [4.4.1. Base URL Info Endpoint](#h.4.4.1)).
The value for `is_index` MUST be `true`.

> **Note**: A list of database providers acknowledged by the
> **Open Databases Integration for Materials Design** consortium can be found in [Appendix 1](#h.app1).
> This list is also machine-readable, optimizing the automatic discoverability.

# <a name="h.4">4. API Endpoints</a>

The URL component that follows the base URL MUST represent one of the
following endpoints:

* an "entry listing" endpoint
* a "single entry" endpoint
* a general filtering `all` endpoint that can search all entry types
* an introspection `info` endpoint
* a `links` endpoint to discover related implementations
* a custom `extensions` endpoint prefix  

These endpoints are documented below.

## <a name="h.4.1">4.1. Entry Listing Endpoints</a>

Entry listing endpoints return a list of resource objects representing entries of a
specific type. For example, a list of structures, or a list of calculations.

Examples:

* <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/structures>
* <http://example.com/optimade/calculations>

There MAY be multiple entry listing endpoints, depending on how many types of
entries an implementation provides. Specific standard entry types are specified in
section [6. Entry list](#h.6). The API implementation MAY provide other
entry types than the ones standardized in this specification, but such entry
types MUST be prefixed by a database-provider-specific prefix.

### <a name="h.4.1.1">4.1.1. URL Query Parameters</a>

The client MAY provide a set of URL query parameters in order to alter
the response and provide usage information. While these URL query
parameters are OPTIONAL for clients, API implementations MUST accept and
handle them. To adhere to the requirement on implementation-specific
URL query parameters of [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org), query
parameters that are not standardized by that specification have been
given names that consist of at least two words separated by an
underscore (a LOW LINE character '\_').

Standard OPTIONAL URL query parameters standardized by the JSON API specification:

* **filter**: a filter string, in the format described below in section
  [5. API Filtering Format Specification](#h.5).

Standard OPTIONAL URL query parameters not in the JSON API specification:

* **response\_format**: specifies which output format is requested. Specifically, the
  format string 'jsonapi' specifies the standard output format documented
  in this specification as the JSON API response format.  
  Example: <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/structures?response_format=xml>
* **email\_address**: specifies an email address of the user making the request. The
  email SHOULD be that of a person and not an automatic system.  
  Example: <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/structures?email_address=user@example.com>
* **response\_limit**: sets a numerical limit on the number of entries returned. The API
  implementation MUST return no more than the number specified. It MAY return
  less. The database MAY have a maximum limit and not accept larger numbers (in
  which case an error code MUST be returned). The default limit value is up
  to the API implementation to decide.  
  Example: <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/structures?response_limit=100>
* **response\_fields**: specify a comma-delimited set of fields to be provided in the
  output. If provided, only these fields MUST be returned and no others.  
  Example: <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/structures?response_fields=id,url>

Additional OPTIONAL URL query parameters not described above are not
considered to be part of this standard, and are instead considered to
be "custom URL query parameters". These custom URL query parameters
MUST be of the format "&lt;database-provider-specific
prefix&gt;&lt;url\_query\_parameter\_name&gt;".  These names adhere to
the requirements on implementation-specific query parameters of
[JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) since the database-provider-specific prefixes
contain at least two underscores (a LOW LINE character '\_').

Example uses of custom URL query parameters include providing an access token for the
request, to tell the database to increase verbosity in error output, or
providing a database-specific extended searching format.

Examples:

* <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/structures?_exmpl_key=A3242DSFJFEJE>
* <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/structures?_exmpl_warning_verbosity=10>
* http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/structures?_exmpl_filter="elements all in [Al, Si, Ga]"

> **Note**: the specification presently makes no attempt to standardize access
> control mechanisms. There are security concerns with access control based on
> URL tokens, and the above example is not to be taken as a recommendation for
> such a mechanism.

### <a name="h.4.1.2">4.1.2. JSON API Response Schema</a>

"Entry listing" endpoint response dictionaries MUST have a `data`
key. The value of this key MUST be a list containing dictionaries that
represent individual entries. In the JSON API format every dictionary
([resource object](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-objects))
needs the following fields:

* **type**: field containing the type of the entry
* **id**: a string which together with the type uniquely identifies the object,
this can be the local database ID
* **attributes**: a dictionary, containing key-value pairs representing the
  entry's properties and the following fields:
  * **local\_id**: the entry's local database ID
  * **last\_modified**: an [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/standard/40874.html)
    representing the entry's last modification time
  * **immutable\_id**: an OPTIONAL field containing the entry's immutable ID (e.g., an UUID)

  Database-provider-specific properties need to include the database-provider-specific prefix
  (see [Appendix 1](#h.app1)).

OPTIONALLY it can also contains the following fields:

* **links**: a [JSON API links object](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-links) can OPTIONALL
contain the field
  * **self**: the entry's URL
* **meta**: a [JSON API meta object](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-meta) that contains
non-standard meta-information about the object
* **relationships**: a dictionary containing references to other resource objects as defined in
[JSON API relationships object](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-relationships)

Example:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "structure",
      "id": "example.db:structs:0001",
      "attributes": {
        "formula": "Es2 O3",
        "local_id": "example.db:structs:0001",
        "url": "http://example.db/structs/0001",
        "immutable_id": "http://example.db/structs/0001@123",
        "modification_date": "2007-04-05T14:30Z"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "structure",
      "id": "example.db:structs:1234",
      "attributes": {
        "formula": "Es2",
        "local_id": "example.db:structs:1234",
        "url": "http://example.db/structs/1234",
        "immutable_id": "http://example.db/structs/1234@123",
        "modification_date": "2007-04-07T12:02Z"
      },
    },
    // ...
  ]
  // ...
}
```

## <a name="h.4.2">4.2. Single Entry Endpoints</a>

A client can request a specific entry by appending an ID component to the URL of an entry listing
endpoint. This will return properties for the entry with that ID.

If using the JSON API format, the ID component MUST be the content of the `id` field.

Note that entries cannot have an ID of `'info'`, as this would collide with the 'Info' endpoint
(described in section [4.4. Info Endpoints](#h.4.4)) for a given entry type.

Examples:

* <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/structures/exmpl:struct_3232823>
* <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/calculations/232132>

### <a name="h.4.2.1">4.2.1. URL Query Parameters</a>

The client MAY provide a set of additional URL query parameters for this endpoint type.
URL query parameters not recognized MUST be ignored. While the following URL query parameters
are OPTIONAL for clients, API implementations MUST accept and handle them:
**response\_format**, **email\_address**, **response\_fields**. The meaning of these URL query parameters are as defined above in section [4.1.1. URL Query Parameters](#h.4.1.1).

### <a name="h.4.2.2">4.2.2. JSON API Response Schema</a>

The response for a 'single entry' endpoint is the same as for 'entry listing'
endpoint responses, except that the value of the `data` field MUST have only one or zero entries.
If using the JSON API format, this means that the response type of the `data` field MUST be
a single response object or `null` if there is no response object to return.

Example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "structure",
    "id": "example.db:structs:1234",
    "attributes": {
      "formula": "Es2",
      "local_id": "example.db:structs:1234",
      "url": "http://example.db/structs/1234",
      "immutable_id": "http://example.db/structs/1234@123",
      "modification_date": "2007-04-07T12:02Z"
    },
  },
  "meta": {
    "query": {
      "representation": "/structures/example.db:structs:1234?"
    },
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

## <a name="h.4.3">4.3. General Entry Listing All Endpoint</a>

The 'general entry listing endpoint' returns a list of entries representing all
entries a database provides, regardless of type. This endpoint MUST be provided
at the path "&lt;base\_url&gt;/all". The purpose of this endpoint is to allow more
general searches across entry types. The general entry listing endpoint MUST
accept both GET and a POST-type requests, with provided POST-type URL query parameters
overriding duplicate URL query parameters provided as GET URL query parameters.

### <a name="h.4.3.1">4.3.1. URL Query Parameters</a>

The following URL query parameters MUST be recognized and handled: **filter**, **response\_fields**,
**response\_format**, **response\_limit**, **email\_address**. The meaning of these URL query
parameters are as defined above in section [4.1.1. URL Query Parameters](#h.4.1.1). Furthermore,
custom OPTIONAL URL query parameters, also described above, are also allowed.

Example: <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/all?response_fields=id,url&response_format=jsonapi>

### <a name="h.4.3.2">4.3.2. JSON API Response Schema</a>

The response for a general entry `all` endpoint is the same as for "entry listing" endpoint responses,
see section [4.1.2 JSON API Response Schema](#h.4.1.2).

## <a name="h.4.4">4.4. Info Endpoints</a>

Info endpoints provide introspective information, either about the API implementation itself,
or about specific entry types.

Info endpoints are constructed by appending "**info**" to any of:

1. the base URL (e.g., <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/info/>)
2. type-specific entry listing endpoints (e.g., <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/structures/info/>)
3. the general entry listing endpoint (e.g., <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/all/info/>)

The types and output content of these info endpoints are described in more detail in the subsections
below. Common for them all are that the `data` field SHOULD return only a single resource object.
If no resource object is provided, the value of the `data` field MUST be `null`.

### <a name="h.4.4.1">4.4.1. Base URL Info Endpoint</a>

The Info endpoint on the base URL or directly after the version number (e.g.
<http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/info>) returns information relating to the API
implementation.

The single resource object's response dictionary MUST include the following fields:

* **type**: `"info"`
* **id**: `"/"`
* **attributes**: Dictionary containing the following fields:
  * **api\_version**: Presently used version of the OPTiMaDe API.
  * **available\_api\_versions**: Dictionary where values are the base URLs for the versions of the
  API that are supported, and the keys are strings giving the full version number provided by that
  base URL. Provided base URLs MUST adhere to the rules in section [3.1. Base URL](#h.3.1).
  * **formats**: List of available output formats.
  * **entry\_types\_by\_format**: Available entry endpoints as a function of output formats.
  * **available\_endpoints**: List of available endpoints (i.e., the string to be appended to the
  base URL).

  `attributes` MAY also include the following OPTIONAL fields:

  * **is\_index**: if `true`, this is an index meta-database base URL (see section
  [3.4. Index Meta-Database](#h.3.4)).

    If this member is *not* provided, the client MUST assume this is **not** an index meta-database
    base URL (i.e., default: `"is_index": false`).

If this is an index meta-database base URL (see section [3.4. Index Meta-Database](#h.3.4)), then the
response dictionary MUST also include the field:

* **relationships**: Dictionary that MAY contain a single
[JSON API relationships object](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-relationships):
  * **default**: Reference to the `child` object under the `links` endpoint that the provider
  has chosen as their "default" OPTiMaDe API database. A client SHOULD present this database as the
  first choice when an end-user chooses this provider.
  This MUST include the field:
    * **data**: [JSON API resource linkage](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-links).
    It MUST be either `null` or contain a single `child` identifier object with the fields:
      * **type**: `child`
      * **id**: ID of the provider's chosen default OPTiMaDe API database. MUST be equal to a valid
      `child` object's `id` under the `links` endpoint.

  Lastly, `is_index` MUST also be included in `attributes` and be `true`.

Example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "info",
    "id": "/",
    "attributes": {
      "api_version": "v0.9",
      "available_api_versions": {
        "0.9.5": "http://db.example.com/optimade/v0.9/",
        "0.9.2": "http://db.example.com/optimade/v0.9.2/",
        "1.0.2": "http://db.example.com/optimade/v1.0/"
      },
      "formats": [
        "json",
        "xml"
      ],
      "entry_types_by_format": {
        "json": [
          "structures",
          "calculations"
        ],
        "xml": [
          "structures"
        ]
      },
      "available_endpoints": [
        "structures",
        "calculations",
        "all",
        "info",
        "links"
      ],
      "is_index": false
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

Example for an index meta-database:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "info",
    "id": "/",
    "attributes": {
      "api_version": "v0.9.8",
      "available_api_versions": {
        "0.9.5": "http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/",
        "0.9.2": "http://example.com/optimade/v0.9.2/",
        "1.0.2": "http://example.com/optimade/v1.0/"
      },
      "formats": [
        "json",
        "xml"
      ],
      "entry_types_by_format": {
        "json": [],
        "xml": []
      },
      "available_endpoints": [
        "info",
        "links"
      ],
      "is_index": true
    },
    "relationships": {
      "default": {
        "data": { "type": "child", "id": "perovskites" }
      }
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

### <a name="h.4.4.2">4.4.2. Entry Listing Info Endpoints</a>

Entry listing info endpoints are of the form "&lt;base\_url&gt;/&lt;entry\_type&gt;/info/"
(e.g., <http://example.com/optimade/v0.9/structures/info/>).  
The response for these endpoints MUST include the following information in the `data` field:

* **description**: Description of the entry.
* **properties**: A dictionary describing queryable properties for this entry type,
where each key is a property ID. Each value is a dictionary, with the *required* key `description`
and *optional* key `unit`.
* **formats**: List of output formats available for this type of entry.
* **output\_fields\_by\_format**: Dictionary of available output fields for this entry type,
where the keys are the values of the `formats` list and the values are the keys of the `properties`
dictionary.

Example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "description": "a structure",
    "properties": {
      "nelements": {
        "description": "Number of elements"
      },
      "lattice_vectors": {
        "description": "Unit cell lattice vectors",
        "unit": "Å"
      }
      // ... <other property descriptions>
    },
    "formats": ["json", "xml"],
    "output_fields_by_format": {
      "json": [
        "nelements",
        "lattice_vectors",
        // ...
      ],
      "xml": ["nelements"]
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

## <a name="h.4.5">4.5. Links Endpoint</a>

This endpoint exposes information on other OPTiMaDe API implementations that are linked to the current
implementation. The endpoint MUST be provided at the path "&lt;base_url&gt;/links".

It may be considered an introspective endpoint, similar to the Info endpoint, but at a higher level:
that is, Info endpoints provide information on the given implementation, while the Links endpoint
provides information on the links between immediately related implementations (in particular, an array
of none or a single `"parent"` object and none or more `"child"` objects, see section [4.5.2 Parent and Child Objects](#h.4.5.2)).

For Links endpoints, the API implementation MAY ignore any provided query parameters.
Alternatively, it MAY optionally handle the parameters specified in section
[4.2.1. URL Query Parameters](#h.4.2.1) for single entry endpoints.

### <a name="h.4.5.1">4.5.1. JSON API Response Schema</a>

The resource objects' response dictionaries MUST include the following fields:

* **type**: MUST be either `"parent"`, `"child"`, or `"provider"`.  
  These objects are described in detail in sections [4.5.2. Parent and Child Objects](#h.4.5.2)
  and [4.5.3. Provider Objects](#h.4.5.3).
* **id**: MUST be unique.
* **attributes**: Dictionary that MUST contain the following fields:
  * **name**: Human-readable name for the OPTiMaDe API implementation a client may provide in a list
  to an end-user.
  * **description**: Human-readable description for the OPTiMaDe API implementation a client may
  provide in a list to an end-user.
  * **base\_url**: [JSON API links object](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-links),
  pointing to the base URL for this implementation, either directly as a string, or as a links object,
  which can contain the following fields:
    * **href**: a string containing the OPTiMaDe base URL.
    * **meta**: a meta object containing non-standard meta-information about the implementation.

  `attributes` MAY also contain the following OPTIONAL members:

  * **local\_id**: String representing the provider's local ID for the implementation.
  This MAY be different from the `id` field's value.

Example:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "parent",
      "id": "index",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "Index",
        "description": "Index for example's OPTiMaDe databases",
        "base_url": "http://example.com/optimade/index"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "child",
      "id": "cat_zeo",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "Catalytic Zeolites",
        "description": "Zeolites for deNOx catalysis",
        "base_url": {
          "href": "http://example.com/optimade/denox/zeolites",
          "meta": {
            "_exmpl_catalyst_group": "denox"
          }
        },
        "local_id": "catalytic_zeolites"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "child",
      "id": "frameworks",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "Zeolitic Frameworks",
        "description": "",
        "base_url": "http://example.com/optimade/zeo_frameworks",
        "local_id": "zeo_frameworks"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "provider",
      "id": "exmpl",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "Example provider",
        "description": "Provider used for examples, not to be assigned to a real database",
        "base_url": "http://example.com/optimade/index"
      }
    },
    // ... <other objects>
  ],
  // ...
}
```

### <a name="h.4.5.2">4.5.2. Parent and Child Objects</a>

Resource objects that MAY be present under the Links endpoint.

Either none or a single `"parent"` object MAY be present as part of the `data` array.
The `"parent"` object represents a "link" to the OPTiMaDe implementation exactly one layer **above**
the current implementation's layer.

Any number of `"child"` objects MAY be present as part of the `data` array. A `"child"` object
represents a "link" to an OPTiMaDe implementation exactly one layer **below** the current
implementation's layer.

> **Note**: The RECOMMENDED number of layers is two.

### <a name="h.4.5.3">4.5.3. Provider Objects</a>

`"provider"` objects are meant to indicate links to an "Index meta-database" hosted by database
providers. The intention is to be able to auto-discover all providers of OPTiMaDe implementations.

A known list of providers can be found in [Appendix 1](#h.app1).

> **Note**: If a provider wishes to be added to `"provider.json"`, please suggest a change to the OPTiMaDe main repository (make a pull request).
A link to the main repository may be found at the [OPTiMaDe homepage](http://www.optimade.org).

### <a name="h.4.5.4">4.5.4. Index Meta-Database Links Endpoint</a>

If the provider implements an "Index meta-database" (see section [3.4 Index Meta-Database](#h.3.4)),
it is RECOMMENDED to adopt a structure, where the index meta-database is the "parent" implementation
of the provider's other OPTiMaDe databases.

This will make all OPTiMaDe databases and implementations by the provider discoverable as `"child"`
objects under the Links endpoint of the "Index meta-database".

## <a name="h.4.6">4.6. Custom Extension Endpoints</a>

API implementors can provide custom endpoints under the Extensions endpoint.
They should have the form "&lt;base\_url&gt;/extensions/&lt;custom paths&gt;".

# <a name="h.5">5. API Filtering Format Specification</a>

A filter language will be used in the `filter=` component of the query string.
The `filter=` component can be used to select a subset of records to be returned for a specific query.
The value of the `filter=` component MUST follow the filter language syntax described below.

The filter language MUST support at least the following features:

* flat filters with one level of "AND" and "OR" conjunctions.

## <a name="h.5.1">5.1. Lexical Tokens</a>

The following tokens are used in the filter query component:

* **Property names** (see section [6. Entry List](#h.6)): Are to follow the identifier
  syntax of programming languages -- the first character MUST be a letter, the subsequent symbols
  MUST be alphanumeric; the underscore ("\_", ASCII 95 dec (0x5F)) is considered to be a letter.
  Identifiers are case-sensitive. The length of the identifiers is not limited, except the whole
  query SHOULD NOT be longer than the limits imposed by the URI specification.

  Examples of valid property names:

  * band\_gap
  * cell\_length\_a
  * cell\_volume

  Examples of incorrect property names:

  * 0\_kvak (starts with a number);
  * "foo bar" (contains space; contains quotes)

  Identifiers that start with an underscore are specific to a database provider,
  and MUST be on the format of a database-provider-specific prefix as defined in [Appendix 1](#h.app1).

  Examples:

  * \_exmpl\_formula\_sum
  * \_exmpl\_band\_gap
  * \_exmpl\_supercell
  * \_exmpl\_trajectory
  * \_exmpl\_workflow\_id

* **String values** MUST be enclosed in double quotes ("", ASCII symbol 92 dec, 0x5C hex).
  The quote and other special characters within the double quotes MUST be escaped using
  C/JSON/Perl/Python convention: a double quote which is a part of the value, not a delimiter,
  MUST be prepended with a backslash character ("\\", ASCII symbol), and the backslash character
  itself, when taken literally, MUST be preceded by another backslash.

* **Numeric values** are represented as decimal integers or in scientific notation, using the usual
  programming language conventions. A regular expression giving the number syntax is given below as a
  [POSIX Extended Regular Expression (ERE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_expression&oldid=786659796#Standards)
  or as a [Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE)](http://www.pcre.org):

  * ERE: `[-+]?([0-9]+(\.[0-9]*)?|\.[0-9]+)([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?`
  * PCRE: `[-+]?(?:\d+(\.\d*)?|\.\d+)(?:[eE][-+]?\d+)?`

  An implementation of the search filter MAY reject numbers that are outside the machine
  representation of the underlying hardware; in such case it MUST return an appropriate error
  message, indicating the cause of the error and an acceptable number range.

  * Examples of valid numbers:

    * 12345, +12, -34, 1.2, .2E7, -.2E+7, +10.01E-10, 6.03e23, .1E1, -.1e1, 1.e-12, -.1e-12,
    1000000000.E1000000000, 1., .1

  * Examples of _invalid_ numbers (although they MAY contain correct numbers as substrings):

    * 1.234D12, .e1, -.E1, +.E2, 1.23E+++, +-123

  More examples of the number tokens and machine-readable definitions and tests can be found in the
  [Materials-Consortia API Git repository](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/API/)
  (files
  [integers.lst](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/API/blob/master/tests/inputs/integers.lst),
  [not-numbers.lst](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/API/blob/master/tests/inputs/not-numbers.lst),
  [numbers.lst](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/API/blob/master/tests/inputs/numbers.lst),
  and
  [reals.lst](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/API/blob/master/tests/inputs/reals.lst)).

* **Operator tokens** are represented by usual mathematical relation symbols or by case-sensitive
  keywords. Currently the following operators are supported: =, !=, &lt;=, &gt;=, &lt;, &gt; for tests
  of number or string (lexicographical) equality, inequality, less-than or equal-to, greater-than or
  equal-to, less-than, and greater-than relations; AND, OR, NOT for logical conjunctions.
  The mathematical relations have higher priority than logical relations; relation NOT has higher
  priority than AND; relation AND has higher priority than OR. Thus, the expression
  `"a >= 0 AND NOT b < c OR c = 0"` is interpreted as
  `"( (a >= 0) AND (NOT (b < c)) ) OR (c = 0)"` if the expression was fully braced.

* The current API specification supports only one level of braces (no nested braces): the expression
  `"a > b AND (a > 0 OR b > 0)"` MUST be supported to allow the change of the priority of the logical
  operations.

## <a name="h.5.2">5.2. The Filter Language Syntax</a>

Filtering expressions MUST follow the following
[EBNF](http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/s026153_ISO_IEC_14977_1996(E).zip)
grammar. Briefly, the filtering expression consists of the prefixing keyword `filter=` that
distinguishes it from other query string components that is followed by a Boolean expression on the
search criteria. In the expression, desired properties are compared against search values; several
such comparisons can be combined using AND, OR, and NOT logical conjunctions with their usual
semantics. Examples of the comparisons and logical expressions:

* spacegroup="P2"
* \_exmpl\_cell\_volume&lt;100.0
* \_exmpl\_bandgap > 5.0 AND \_exmpl\_molecular\_weight &lt; 350

The precedence (priority) of the operators MUST be as indicated in the list below:

1. The comparison operators ('&lt;', '&lt;=', '=', etc.) -- highest priority;
2. NOT
3. AND
4. OR -- lowest priority.

Thus, the expression `"NOT a > b OR c = 100 AND f = \"C2 H6\""` is interpreted as
`"(NOT (a > b)) OR ( (c = 100) AND (f = \"C2 H6\") )"`, when fully braced.

The top-level rules of the Filter language grammar:

```EBNF
(* The top-level 'filter' rule: *)
Filter = Keyword, Expression;
(* Keywords *)
Keyword = "filter=" ;
(* Values *)
Value = Identifier | Number | String ;
(* The white-space: *)
Space = ' ' | '\t' ;
Spaces = Space, { Space } ;
(* Boolean relations: *)
AND = "AND" ; (* a short-hand for: AND = 'A', 'N', 'D' *)
NOT = "NOT" ;
OR = "OR" ;
(* Expressions *)
Expression = Term, [Spaces], [ OR, [Spaces], Expression ] ;
Term = Atom, [Spaces], [ AND, [Spaces], Term ] ;
Atom = [ NOT, [Spaces] ], ( Comparison |
           '(', [Spaces], AndComparison,
                [Spaces], { OR,
                [Spaces], AndComparison, [Spaces] }, ')' );
AndComparison = [ NOT, [Spaces] ], Comparison,
                [Spaces], { AND,
                [Spaces], [ NOT, [Spaces] ], Comparison, [Spaces] } ;
(* Comparison operator tokens: *)
Operator = '<', [ '=' ] | '>', [ '=' ] | '=' | '!', '=' ;
Comparison = Value, [Spaces], Operator, [Spaces], Value ;
```

The structure of tokens 'Identifier', 'Number', 'String', and 'Operator' are described above in
section [5.1. Lexical Tokens](#h.5.1) and omitted here for brevity; a full length machine readable
version of the grammar, including the definition  of the lexical tokens, is available in the
[Materials-Consortia API Git repository](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/API) (file
[grammars/flat-filters.ebnf](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/API/blob/master/grammars/flat-filters.ebnf)).

Since the usual arithmetic expression syntax used for specifying filter expressions can contain
characters that are not URL transparent, they MUST be URL-encoded before their use in a GET query.
The specified order of the escaping and encoding of the Filter language statements is the following:

1. special characters in string values MUST be escaped first as described above in section
  [5.1. Lexical Tokens](#h.5.1) under "String values".
2. the resulting expression MUST be URL-encoded.

The extraction flow is the opposite -- first the Filter string MUST be first URL-decoded,
and after that, string tokens MUST be unescaped to get values for comparisons.

When comparisons are performed, comparison operators '&lt;', '&lt;=', '=', '!=', and so on are
interpreted either as numeric value comparisons or as string comparisons, depending on the type
of the search parameter. The literal string value MUST be converted to the type of the search
parameter (e.g., `x > "0.0"`, where `x` is a coordinate, MUST treat this expression as numeric filter
`x > 0`, and `s = 0` search against text parameter `s` MUST perform string comparison as in
`s = "0"`). Strings are converted to numbers using the token syntax specified in section
[5.1. Lexical Tokens](#h.5.1). "Numeric values"; numbers SHOULD be converted to strings using the libc
'%g' format. In all cases the application MUST return a warning, when conversion was performed, and
specify the actual search values that were used.

For comparisons of two parameters (e.g., `x > y`) or two constants (e.g., `1 = 1`) both compared values
MUST be of the same type (i.e., both MUST be either numeric or string values); implementation MUST
return an error if this is not the case.

Examples of syntactically correct filter strings:

* filter=\_exmpl\_melting\_point&lt;300 AND nelements=4 AND elements="Si,O2"

Examples of syntactically correct query strings embedded in queries:

* <http://example.org/optimade/v0.9/structures?filter=_exmpl_melting_point%3C300+AND+nelements=4+AND+elements="Si,O2"&response_format=xml>

## <a name="h.6.2">6.2. Structure Entries</a>

`"structure"` entries (or objects) have the properties described above in section
[6.1. Properties Used by Multiple Entry Types](#h.6.1), as well as the following properties:

### <a name="h.6.2.1">6.2.1. elements</a>

* **Description**: Names of elements found in the structure.
* **Requirements/Conventions**: String of chemical symbols of elements joined by commas.
* **Examples**:
  * `"Si"`
  * `"Si,Al,O"`
* **Querying**: The conjunction means "AND", e.g., for `element="Si,Al,O"` all records pertaining to
  structures containing Si **and** Al **and** O, and possibly other elements, MUST be returned;
  use `nelements=3` to specify **exactly** 3 elements; (`element="Si,Al,O"` means you want structures
  with at *least* the 3 elements, and it MUST contain Si AND Al AND O).

### <a name="h.6.2.2">6.2.2. nelements</a>

* **Description**: Number of elements found in a structure.
* **Requirements/Conventions**: Integer value.
* **Example**: `3`
* **Querying**: Use numerical operators, as defined in the filtering section
  [5. API Filtering Format Specification](#h.5).  
  Examples:
  * return only entities that have exactly 4 elements: `"nelements=4"`
  * query for structures that have between 2 and 7 elements: `"nelements>=2+AND+nelements<=7"`

### <a name="h.6.2.3">6.2.3. chemical\_formula</a>

* **Description**: The chemical formula for a structure.
* **Requirements/Conventions**:
  * The formula MUST be **reduced**.
  * Element names MUST be with proper capitalization (e.g., `"Si"`, not `"SI"` for "silicon").
  * The order in which elements are specified SHOULD NOT be significant (e.g., "O2Si" is equivalent
    to "SiO2").
  * No spaces or separators are allowed.

### <a name="h.6.2.4">6.2.4. formula\_prototype</a>

* **Description**: The formula prototype obtained by sorting elements by the occurrence number in the
  **reduced** chemical formula and replace them with subsequent alphabet letters A, B, C, and so on.

### <a name="h.6.2.5">6.2.5. dimension\_types</a>

* **Description**: List of three integers. For each of the three directions indicated by the three
lattice vectors (see property [6.2.6. `lattice_vectors`](#h.6.2.6)). This list indicates if the
direction is periodic (value `1`) or non-periodic (value `0`). Note: the elements in this list each
refer to the direction of the corresponding entry in [6.2.6. `lattice_vectors`](#h.6.2.6) and *not*
the Cartesian x, y, z directions.
* **Requirements/Conventions**:
  * This property is REQUIRED.
  * It MUST be a list of length 3.
  * Each element MUST be an integer and MUST assume only the value `0` or `1`.
* **Examples**:
  * For a molecule: `[0, 0, 0]`
  * For a wire along the direction specified by the third lattice vector: `[0, 0, 1]`
  * For a 2D surface/slab, periodic on the plane defined by the first and third
    lattice vectors: `[1, 0, 1]`
  * For a bulk 3D system: `[1, 1, 1]`

### <a name="h.6.2.6">6.2.6. lattice\_vectors</a>

* **Description**: The three lattice vectors in Cartesian coordinates, in ångström (Å).
* **Requirements/Conventions**:
  * This property is REQUIRED, except when [6.2.5. `dimension_types`](#h.6.2.5) is equal to
  `[0, 0, 0]` (in this case it is OPTIONAL).
  * It MUST be a list of three vectors *a*, *b*, and *c*, where each of the vectors MUST BE a list of
  the vector's coordinates along the x, y, and z Cartesian coordinates. (Therefore, the first index
  runs over the three lattice vectors and the second index runs over the x, y, z Cartesian
  coordinates).
  * For databases that do not define an absolute Cartesian system (e.g., only defining the length and
  angles between vectors), the first lattice vector SHOULD be set along `x` and the second on the `xy`
  plane.
  * This property MUST be an array of dimensions 3 times 3 regardless of the elements of
  [6.2.5. `dimension_types`](#h.6.2.5). The vectors SHOULD by convention be chosen so the determinant
  of the `lattice_vectors` matrix is different from zero. The vectors in the non-periodic directions
  have no significance beyond fulfilling these requirements.
* **Examples**:
  * `[[4.,0.,0.],[0.,4.,0.],[0.,1.,4.]]` represents a cell, where the first vector is
  `(4, 0, 0)`, i.e., a vector aligned along the `x` axis of length 4 Å; the second vector is
  `(0, 4, 0)`; and the third vector is `(0, 1, 4)`.

### <a name="h.6.2.7">6.2.7. cartesian\_site\_positions</a>

* **Description**: Cartesian positions of each site. A site is an atom, a site potentially occupied by
an atom, or a placeholder for a virtual mixture of atoms (e.g., in a virtual crystal approximation).
* **Requirements/Conventions**:
  * This property is REQUIRED.
  * It MUST be a list of length N times 3, where N is the number of sites in the structure.
  * An entry MAY have multiple sites at the same Cartesian position (for a relevant use of this, see
  e.g., the [6.2.10.`assemblies`](#h.6.2.10) property).
* **Examples**:
  * `[[0,0,0],[0,0,2]]` indicates a structure with two sites, one sitting at the origin and one along
  the (positive) `z` axis, 2 Å away from the origin.

### <a name="h.6.2.8">6.2.8. species\_at\_sites</a>

* **Description**: Name of the species at each site (where values for sites are specified with the
same order of the [6.2.7. `cartesian_site_positions`](#h.6.2.7) property). The properties of the
species are found in the [6.2.9. `species`](#h.6.2.9) property.
* **Requirements/Conventions**:
  * This property is REQUIRED.
  * It MUST be a list of strings, which MUST have length equal to the number of sites in the structure
    (first dimension of the [6.2.7. `cartesian_site_positions`](#h.6.2.7) list).
  * Each string MUST be a valid key of the dictionary specified by the [6.2.9. `species`](#h.6.2.9)
    property. The requirements on this string are the same as for property names, i.e., it can be of any
    length, may use upper and lower case letters, underscore, and digits 0-9, but MUST NOT begin with a
    digit.
  * Each site MUST be associated only to a single species.  
    **Note**: However, species can represent mixtures of atoms, and multiple species MAY be defined
    for the same chemical element. This latter case is useful when different atoms of the same type
    need to be grouped or distinguished, for instance in simulation codes to assign different initial
    spin states).
* **Examples**:
  * `["Ti","O2"]` indicates that the first site is hosting a species labeled `"Ti"` and the second a
  species labeled `"O2"`.

### <a name="h.6.2.9">6.2.9. species</a>

* **Description**: Dictionary describing the species of the sites of this structure. Species can be
pure chemical elements, or virtual-crystal atoms representing a statistical occupation of a given site
by multiple chemical elements.
* **Requirements/Conventions**:
  * This property is REQUIRED.
  * It MUST be a dictionary, where keys represent the species' name, and values are themselves
  dictionaries with the following keys:
    * **chemical\_symbols**: REQUIRED; MUST be a list of strings of all chemical elements composing
    this species. It MUST be one of the following:
      * a valid chemical-element name, or
      * the special value `"X"` to represent a non-chemical element, or
      * the special value `"vacancy"` to represent that this site has a non-zero probability of having
      a vacancy (the respective probability is indicated in the `concentration` list, see below).

    * **concentration**: REQUIRED; MUST be a list of floats, with same length as `chemical_symbols`.
    The numbers represent the relative concentration of the corresponding chemical symbol in this
    species. The numbers SHOULD sum to one. Cases in which the numbers do not sum to one typically
    fall only in the following two categories:
      * Numerical errors when representing float numbers in fixed precision. E.g. for two chemical
      symbols with concentration `1/3` and `2/3`, the concentration might look something like
      `[0.33333333333, 0.66666666666]`. If the client is aware that the sum is not one because of
      numerical precision, it can renormalize the values so that the sum is exactly one.
      * Experimental errors in the data present in the database. In this case, it is the
      responsibility of the client to decide how to process the data.

      Note that concentrations are uncorrelated between different sites (even of the same species).

    * **mass**: OPTIONAL. If present MUST be a float expressed in a.m.u.
    * **original_name**: OPTIONAL. Can be any valid unicode string, and SHOULD contain (if specified)
    the name of the species that is used internally in the source database.  
    Note: With regards to "source database", we refer to the immediate source being queried via the
    OPTiMaDe API implemention. The main use of this field is for source databases that use species
    names, containing characters that are not allowed (see description of the
    [6.2.8. `species_at_sites`](#h.6.2.8) list).

  * For systems that have only species formed by a single chemical symbol, and that have at most one
  species per chemical symbol, SHOULD use the chemical symbol as species name (e.g., `"Ti"` for
  titanium, `"O"` for oxygen, etc.) However, note that this is OPTIONAL, and client implementations
  MUST NOT assume that the key corresponds to a chemical symbol, nor assume that if the species name
  is a valid chemical symbol, that it represents a species with that chemical symbol. This means that
  a species `"C": {"chemical_symbols": ["Ti"], "concentration": [1.0]}` is valid and represents a
  titanium species (and *not* a carbon species).
  * It is NOT RECOMMENDED that a structure includes species that do not have at least one
  corresponding site.
* **Examples**:
  * `"Ti": {"chemical_symbols": ["Ti"], "concentration": [1.0]}`: any site with this species is
  occupied by a Ti atom.
  * `"Ti": {"chemical_symbols": ["Ti", "vacancy"], "concentration": [0.9, 0.1]}`: any site with this
  species is occupied by a Ti atom with 90 % probability, and has a vacancy with 10 % probability.
  * `"BaCa": {"chemical_symbols": ["vacancy", "Ba", "Ca"], "concentration": [0.05, 0.45, 0.5], "mass": 88.5}`: any site with this species is occupied by a Ba atom with 45 % probability, a Ca atom with
  50 % probability, and by a vacancy with 5 % probability. The mass of this site is (on average) 88.5
  a.m.u.
  * `"C12": {"chemical_symbols": ["C"], "concentration": [1.0], "mass": 12.}`: any site with this
  species is occupied by a carbon isotope with mass 12.
  * `"C13": {"chemical_symbols": ["C"], "concentration": [1.0], "mass": 13.}`: any site with this
  species is occupied by a carbon isotope with mass 13.

### <a name="h.6.2.10">6.2.10. assemblies</a>

* **Description**: A description of groups of sites that are statistically correlated.
* **Requirements/Conventions**:
  * This key is OPTIONAL (it is absent if there are no partial occupancies).
  * Client implementations MUST check its presence (as its presence changes the interpretation of the
  structure).
  * If present, it MUST be a list of dictionaries, each of which represents an assembly and MUST have
  the following two keys:
    * **sites\_in\_groups**: Index of the sites (0-based) that belong to each group for each assembly.  
    Example: `[[1], [2]]`: two groups, one with the second site, one with the third.  
    Example: `[[1,2], [3]]`: one group with the second and third site, one with the fourth.
    * **group\_probabilities**: Statistical probability of each group. It MUST have the same length of
    `sites_in_groups`. It SHOULD sum to one. See below for examples of how to specify the probability
    of the occurrence of a vacancy. The possible reasons for the values not to sum to one are the same
    as already specified above for the `concentration` of each `species`, see section
    [6.2.9. `species`](#h.6.2.9).
  * If a site is not present in any group, it means that is is present with 100 % probability (as if
  no assembly was specified).
  * A site MUST NOT appear in more than one group.
* **Examples** (for each entry of the assemblies list):
  * `{"sites_in_groups": [[0], [1]], "group_probabilities: [0.3, 0.7]}`: the first site and the second
  site never occur at the same time in the unit cell. Statistically, 30 % of the times the first site
  is present, while 70 % of the times the second site is present.
  * `{"sites_in_groups": [[1,2], [3]], "group_probabilities: [0.3, 0.7]}`: The second and third site
  are either present together or not present; they form the first group of atoms for this assembly.
  The second group is formed by the fourth site. Sites of the first group (the second and the third)
  are never present at the same time as the fourth site. 30 % of times sites 1 and 2 are present (and
  site 3 is absent); 70 % of times site 3 is present (and sites 1 and 2 are absent).
* **Notes**:
  * Assemblies are essential to represent, for instance, the situation where an atom can statistically
  occupy two different positions (sites).
  * By defining groups, it is possible to represent, e.g., the case where a functional molecule (and
  not just one atom) is either present or absent (or the case where it it is present in two
  conformations)
  * Considerations on virtual alloys and on vacancies:  
  In the special case of a virtual alloy, these specifications allow two different, equivalent ways of
  specifying them. For instance, for a site at the origin with 30 % probability of being occupied by
  Si, 50 % probability of being occupied by Ge, and 20 % of being a vacancy, the following two
  representations are possible:
    * Using a single species:

      ```json
      {
        "cartesian_site_positions": [[0,0,0]],
        "species_at_sites": ["SiGe-vac"],
        "species": {
          "SiGe-vac": {
            "chemical_symbols": ["Si", "Ge", "vacancy"],
            "concentration": [0.3, 0.5, 0.2]
          }
        }
        // ...
      }
      ```

    * Using multiple species and the assemblies:

      ```json
      {
        "cartesian_site_positions": [ [0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0] ],
        "species_at_sites": ["Si", "Ge", "vac"],
        "species": {
          "Si": { "chemical_symbols": ["Si"], "concentration": [1.] },
          "Ge": { "chemical_symbols": ["Ge"], "concentration": [1.] },
          "vac": { "chemical_symbols": ["vacancy"], "concentration": [1.] }
        },
        "assemblies": [
          {
            "sites_in_groups": [ [0], [1], [2] ],
            "group_probabilities": [0.3, 0.5, 0.2]
          }
        ]
        // ...
      }
      ```

  * It is up to the database provider to decide which representation to use, typically depending on
  the internal format in which the structure is stored. However, given a structure identified by a
  unique ID, the API implementation MUST always provide the same representation for it.
  * The probabilities of occurrence of different assemblies are uncorrelated. So, for instance in the following case with two assemblies:

    ```json
    {
      "assemblies": [
        {
          "sites_in_groups": [ [0], [1] ],
          "group_probabilities": [0.2, 0.8],
        },
        {
          "sites_in_groups": [ [2], [3] ],
          "group_probabilities": [0.3, 0.7]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Site 0 is present with a probability of 20 % and site 1 with a probability of 80 %. These two
    sites are correlated (either site 0 or 1 is present). Similarly, site 2 is present with
    a probability of 30 % and site 3 with a probability of 70 %. These two sites are correlated
    (either site 2 or 3 is present).  
    However, the presence or absence of sites 0 and 1 is not correlated with the presence or absence
    of sites 2 and 3 (in the specific example, the pair of sites (0, 2) can occur with 0.2\*0.3 = 6 %
    probability; the pair (0, 3) with 0.2\*0.7 = 14 % probability; the pair (1, 2) with
    0.8\*0.3 = 24 % probability; and the pair (1, 3) with 0.8\*0.7 = 56 % probability).

## <a name="h.6.3">6.3. Calculation Entries</a>

`"calculation"` entries have the properties described above in section
[6.1. Properties Used by Multiple Entry Types](#h.6.1).

## <a name="h.app1">Appendix 1: Database-Provider-Specific Namespace Prefixes</a>

This standard refers to database-provider-specific prefixes.
These are assigned and included in this standard in the file `providers.json`.

API implementations SHOULD NOT make up and use new prefixes not included in this standard,
but SHOULD rather work to get such prefixes included in a future revision of this API specification.

**Example**:  
Database-provder-specific prefix: `"exmpl"`  
Use as a field name in a response: `_exmpl_custom_field`

The initial underscore indicates an identifier that is under a separate namespace under the ownership
of that organisation. Identifiers prefixed with underscores will not be used for standardized names.

The database-provider-specific prefixes currently assigned are listed in the `providers.json` file
provided in the main repository. This file serves as a machine-readable list of OPTiMaDe providers.

The content of the `providers.json` file follows the same JSON API specifications as the rest of the
API, in particular the resource objects under the top-level `data` field are defined to be valid
resource objects for the Links endpoint, see section [4.5.3. Provider Objects](#h.4.5.3).
