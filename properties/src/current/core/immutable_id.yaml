  **Requirements/Conventions:**

  - This is important for databases having preferred IDs that point to "the latest version" of a record, but still offer access to older variants.
  - This ID maps to the version-specific record, in case it changes in the future.
examples:
  - "8bd3e750-b477-41a0-9b11-3a799f21b44f"
  - "fjeiwoj,54;@=%<>#32"
x-optimade-unit: "inapplicable"
