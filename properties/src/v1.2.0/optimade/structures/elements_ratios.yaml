  Relative proportions of different elements in the structure.

  **Requirements/Conventions**:

  - Composed by the proportions of elements in the structure as a list of floating point numbers.
  - The sum of the numbers MUST be 1.0 (within floating point accuracy)
  - MUST refer to the same elements in the same order, and therefore be of the same length, as `elements`_, if the latter is provided.

  **Query examples**:

  - Note: Useful filters can be formulated using the set operator syntax for correlated values.
    However, since the values are floating point values, the use of equality comparisons is generally inadvisable.
  - OPTIONAL: a filter that matches structures where approximately 1/3 of the atoms in the structure are the element Al is: `elements:elements_ratios HAS ALL "Al":>0.3333, "Al":<0.3334`.
examples:
  - [1.0]
  - [0.3333333333333333, 0.2222222222222222, 0.4444444444444444]
